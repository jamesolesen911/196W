      <h1>James Olesen's Page </h1>
    <p>For this page, I want to bring up the ways that various instruments are incredibly similar, which allows a skilled musician to be able to 
        play multiple instruments by learning the fundamentals of only one. This is shown through the instrument family I am most familiar with: <strong>brass instruments.</strong>
        For all brass instruments, a cup-shaped mouthpiece is blown into while creating similar to a buzzing sound with the lips. Almost all brass instruments feature 3
        valved buttons that change pitches. While unconventional, all brass instruments can use the button combinations of any other brass instrument to create the 
        same written note (the combination for a written A for a trumpet is the same for a french horn). Therefore, knowledge of how to play trumpet, as an example, provides 
        the <strong>foundation</strong> to play french horn, tuba, euphonium, and all other valved brass instruments.
         Even trombone is similar after recognizing that the 7 button combinations directly transfer over to slide positions. This, however, recognizes that while
         foundationally the same, <strong>each instrument does have characteristic differences from the others</strong>. A skilled musician will utilize their fundamental knowledge
         and apply that to another instrument, but must still learn the details about what makes instruments different. As an example, a trumpet player has the fundamental knowledge
         of how to play french horn in that the mouthpiece and valve combinations function the same way, but lacks the detailed knowledge of the instrument, 
         such as how a french horn player's hand must be inserted into the bell while playing, which is not true of the other brass instruments.
         Other information about these instruments can be found <a href="https://www.beginband.com/brass.shtml" title="Brass for beginners" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
